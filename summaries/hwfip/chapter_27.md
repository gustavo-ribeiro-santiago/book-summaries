### **Core idea:**

**Praise every improvement, no matter how small.**

Put simply: **encouragement creates more progress than criticism.**

---

### **The central principle**

When you praise improvement, you get more improvement.

When you criticize failure, you get discouragement and less effort.

> "Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise."

---

### **Why praise works**

- It reinforces the behavior you want
- It builds confidence
- It creates positive momentum
- It makes people want to do better

Praise is fuel for effort.

---

### **The specificity principle**

Vague praise is weak: "Good job."

Specific praise is powerful: "The way you handled that customer complaint was excellent—you stayed calm and found a solution quickly."

Specific praise shows you actually noticed.

---

### **How to apply this**

- Catch people doing things right
- Acknowledge even small improvements
- Be specific about what they did well
- Praise the effort, not just the result

Make praise a habit.

---

### **The opposite: criticism**

Constant criticism:
- Destroys confidence
- Creates fear of trying
- Damages relationships
- Reduces motivation

People don't improve under a constant barrage of negativity.

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 6: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise."

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Develop people effectively
- Build confidence and capability
- Create a positive environment

Then:
- Notice improvements, no matter how small
- Praise specifically and sincerely
- Make encouragement your default

**Praise grows what criticism kills.**
