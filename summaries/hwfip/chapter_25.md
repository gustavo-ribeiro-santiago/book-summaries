### **Core idea:**

**Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.**

Put simply: **people prefer to feel they have a choice.**

---

### **The central principle**

No one likes being told what to do.

But everyone is willing to consider a suggestion or answer a question.

> Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the person you ask.

---

### **Why questions work better**

- They preserve dignity
- They create ownership
- They invite participation
- They stimulate thinking

A question engages; an order alienates.

---

### **How to apply this**

Instead of: "Do this."

Try:
- "What do you think about...?"
- "Would it make sense to...?"
- "How might we...?"
- "What if we tried...?"

Turn commands into consultations.

---

### **The ownership effect**

When people contribute to a decision, they own it.

When they're told what to do, they comply—but don't commit.

---

### **Examples**

- Instead of "File these reports": "Do you think these reports should be filed alphabetically or by date?"
- Instead of "Fix this bug": "What approach would you take to solve this issue?"

Involvement creates investment.

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 4: Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Get willing cooperation
- Develop others' capabilities
- Lead without creating resistance

Then:
- Replace orders with questions
- Involve people in decisions
- Let them find solutions

**A question invites; an order demands.**
