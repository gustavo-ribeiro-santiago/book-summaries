### **Core idea:**

**Call attention to mistakes indirectly.**

Put simply: **avoid direct criticism—use hints and suggestions instead.**

---

### **The central principle**

Direct criticism triggers defensiveness.

Indirect approaches allow people to recognize mistakes without feeling attacked.

---

### **The "but" problem**

Many people praise, then say "but" followed by criticism:
- "You did great work, BUT you need to improve your timing."

The "but" erases the praise. The person only hears the criticism.

---

### **The solution: use "and"**

Replace "but" with "and":
- "You did great work, AND I think your timing could make it even better."

This maintains the praise while still addressing the issue.

---

### **Other indirect approaches**

- Ask questions instead of giving orders
- Share a similar mistake you made
- Praise the positive, then hint at improvements
- Let them discover the error themselves

The goal is correction without confrontation.

---

### **Why indirectness works**

- It preserves dignity
- It avoids triggering ego defenses
- It feels like guidance, not judgment
- It maintains the relationship

People accept suggestions more easily than criticisms.

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 2: Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Correct mistakes effectively
- Avoid creating resentment
- Be heard, not resisted

Then:
- Avoid direct criticism
- Use "and" instead of "but"
- Hint rather than accuse

**Indirection achieves what directness cannot.**
