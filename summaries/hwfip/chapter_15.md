### **Core idea:**

**Let the other person do most of the talking.**

Put simply: **people need to express themselves—let them.**

---

### **The central principle**

When someone has a complaint, frustration, or idea, they need to get it out.

If you interrupt or argue, you make things worse. If you listen, you let off steam.

> Most people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves.

### **Why letting them talk works**

- It releases emotional pressure
- It makes them feel heard
- It gives you information
- It often resolves the issue on its own

Sometimes people just need to vent—not get advice.

---

### **The safety valve effect**

Like a pressure cooker, emotions need a release valve.

When you let someone talk, you release that pressure safely.

When you argue or interrupt, the pressure builds—and explodes.

---

### **How to apply this**

- Ask open questions, then listen
- Don't interrupt—even if you disagree
- Show you're listening (nod, respond briefly)
- Let them finish completely before speaking

Silence can be your most powerful tool.

---

### **What not to do**

- Don't jump in with your opinion
- Don't try to "fix" before understanding
- Don't make it about you
- Don't argue with their feelings

Let them empty their cup before you try to fill it.

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 6: Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Handle complaints effectively
- Build trust and rapport
- Understand before being understood

Then:
- Listen more than you speak
- Let them express fully
- Use silence strategically

**The person who talks least often achieves most.**
