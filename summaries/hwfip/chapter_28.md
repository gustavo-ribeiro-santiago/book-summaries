### **Core idea:**

**Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.**

Put simply: **expect the best, and people rise to meet it.**

---

### **The central principle**

If you want someone to improve, act as if they already possess the quality you want to see.

Give them a reputation to uphold, and they'll work to maintain it.

> "Give a dog a good name."

---

### **Why this works**

- People live up to expectations
- A positive label creates internal motivation
- It appeals to their desire to be seen positively
- It provides a standard to maintain

The prophecy becomes self-fulfilling.

---

### **How to apply this**

- Tell employees they're known for quality work
- Tell children they're responsible and trustworthy
- Tell colleagues they're excellent collaborators
- Praise the trait you want to strengthen

Name the virtue, and watch it grow.

---

### **Examples**

- "I'm giving you this task because you're one of the most reliable people here."
- "I've always admired your attention to detail."
- "People respect your integrity—that's why this matters."

The reputation becomes something to protect.

### **The psychology**

People want to be consistent with how they're seen.

When you see them as capable and good, they want to prove you right.

When you see them as failures, they often confirm that too.

### **The chapter's principle**
