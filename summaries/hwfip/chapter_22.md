### **Core idea:**

**If you must criticize, begin with genuine praise.**

Put simply: **start positive before addressing negatives.**

---

### **The central principle**

It's easier to listen to criticism after hearing praise.

Starting with sincere appreciation opens the mind; starting with criticism closes it.

> It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.

---

### **Why this works**

- Praise lowers defenses
- It shows you see the whole picture
- It makes criticism feel fair, not hostile
- It preserves the person's dignity

The same message lands differently based on how it begins.

### **The dentist analogy**

A dentist uses novocain before drilling.

Praise is like novocain—it numbs the pain of what follows.

Without it, the procedure is much more painful.

---

### **How to apply this**

Before critiquing:
1. Find something genuinely praiseworthy
2. Express it sincerely
3. Then address the issue that needs correction

The praise must be real—fake praise is worse than none.

---

### **Examples**

- "Your report was thorough and well-researched. Let's talk about one area that could be strengthened..."
- "I appreciate how hard you've been working. I noticed one thing we could improve..."

Lead with the positive.

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 1: Begin with praise and honest appreciation.

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Give feedback that's actually heard
- Correct without creating resentment
- Maintain good relationships

Then:
- Start with genuine praise
- Acknowledge what's working
- Then address what needs improvement

**Praise prepares the ground for change.**
