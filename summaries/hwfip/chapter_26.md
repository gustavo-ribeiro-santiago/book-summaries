### **Core idea:**

**Let the other person save face.**

Put simply: **never embarrass someone publicly—preserve their dignity.**

---

### **The central principle**

Even when someone is clearly wrong, humiliating them creates an enemy.

Letting them save face creates a friend—or at least avoids making an enemy.

> "I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

### **Why face-saving matters**

- Dignity is precious to everyone
- Public humiliation creates lasting resentment
- People remember how you made them feel
- A face-saving moment creates gratitude

The way you handle someone's mistake matters as much as the mistake itself.

---

### **How to let someone save face**

- Criticize privately, never publicly
- Give them a graceful exit
- Focus on the issue, not the person
- Acknowledge the difficulty of their situation

Even when you're right, be kind about it.

---

### **Examples**

- Fire someone with dignity and a good reference
- Correct someone privately after a meeting
- Offer explanations that preserve their self-image
- Give credit even when taking corrective action

---

### **The long-term cost of humiliation**

A moment of public triumph over someone can create:
- A lifelong enemy
- Damage to your reputation
- Future retaliation

Is being right worth that price?

### **The chapter's principle**

Then:

**Saving someone's face costs nothing but buys everything.**
