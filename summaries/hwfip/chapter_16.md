### **Core idea:**

**Let the other person feel the idea is theirs.**

Put simply: **people support what they help create.**

---

### **The central principle**

No one likes being told what to do or think.

But everyone loves their own ideas.

If you can make someone feel an idea is theirs, they'll champion it with enthusiasm.

---

### **Why this works**

- Ownership creates commitment
- People defend their own ideas fiercely
- It removes resistance to change
- It builds buy-in naturally

An idea someone "discovers" is worth ten ideas forced upon them.

---

### **How to apply this**

- Ask questions that lead to your conclusion
- Plant seeds and let them grow
- Give credit generously
- Say "What do you think?" instead of "Here's what to do"

Let them arrive at the idea themselves.

---

### **The ego factor**

People's egos are invested in their ideas.

When you present an idea as yours, you're competing with their ego.

When you let them feel ownership, their ego works *for* you, not against.

---

### **Examples**

- Instead of proposing a solution, ask: "What would you suggest?"
- Instead of giving instructions, ask: "How would you approach this?"
- Instead of taking credit, say: "Based on what you said earlier..."

---

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 7: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Get enthusiastic cooperation
- Implement ideas successfully
- Reduce resistance to change

Then:
- Guide, don't dictate
- Ask, don't tell
- Give away the credit

**The best leaders make others feel like leaders.**
