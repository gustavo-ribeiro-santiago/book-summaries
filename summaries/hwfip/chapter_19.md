### **Core idea:**

**Appeal to people's nobler motives.**

Put simply: **assume the best in people, and they'll rise to meet it.**

---

### **The central principle**

Everyone wants to see themselves as honest, fair, and good.

When you appeal to these ideals, people often live up to them—even if their behavior suggests otherwise.

> A person usually has two reasons for doing something: one that sounds good, and the real one.

---

### **Why this works**

- It gives them a chance to be their best self
- It avoids confrontation and shame
- It appeals to their self-image
- It creates internal motivation to follow through

People want to be seen as noble—help them see themselves that way.

---

### **How to apply this**

Instead of accusing or demanding, try:
- "I know you're a fair person, so I'm confident we can work this out."
- "I trust your sense of integrity..."
- "Because I know you value honesty..."

Frame requests around their better nature.

---

### **The psychology**

People live up to—or down to—expectations.

When you expect the best, you often get it. When you expect the worst, you confirm it.

---

### **Examples**

- A debt collector who appeals to honor gets paid faster
- A manager who trusts employees gets better work
- A negotiator who assumes good faith gets better deals

Assume nobility and watch it appear.

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 10: Appeal to the nobler motives.

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Bring out the best in people
- Get cooperation without conflict
- Inspire better behavior

Then:
- Assume good intentions
- Appeal to their higher values
- Give them a reputation to live up to

**Expect the best, and you'll often receive it.**
