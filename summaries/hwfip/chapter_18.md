### **Core idea:**

**Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.**

Put simply: **everyone wants sympathy—give it freely.**

---

### **The central principle**

People crave understanding. They want someone to acknowledge their feelings.

When you show sympathy, you create a bond that opens them to your influence.

> "I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I would undoubtedly feel just as you do."

### **Why sympathy works**

- It validates their feelings
- It reduces defensiveness
- It creates connection
- It makes them receptive to your view

People are more open to those who understand them.

### **The magic phrase**

Carnegie suggests a simple formula:

> "I don't blame you for feeling that way. In your situation, I'd feel exactly the same."

This single statement can defuse hostility and open dialogue.

### **What sympathy is NOT**

- It's not agreeing they're right
- It's not being fake or manipulative
- It's not giving in to unreasonable demands

It's simply acknowledging their feelings are valid *to them*.

---

### **How to apply this**

- Listen to their frustration without arguing
- Acknowledge their feelings before offering solutions
- Use phrases like: "I understand why you'd feel that way"
- Show you genuinely care about their experience

Sympathy first, solutions second.
