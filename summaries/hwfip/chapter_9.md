### **Core idea:**

**Make people feel important—and do it sincerely.**

Put simply: **give honest, sincere appreciation.**

---

### **The central principle**

The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.

When you satisfy that craving honestly, people will cherish you.

> "Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him." — Emerson

### **Why this works**

- Everyone wants to feel significant
- Genuine appreciation is rare—most people criticize
- Recognition creates loyalty and goodwill
- It costs nothing but means everything

Making someone feel important is one of the greatest gifts you can give.

---

### **How to do it sincerely**

- Find something you genuinely admire
- Be specific—vague praise feels hollow
- Focus on their actions, achievements, or qualities
- Say it directly, without expectation of return

The key word is *sincere*. Flattery is insincere praise; appreciation is honest recognition.

---

### **The golden rule in action**

Ask yourself: "What is there about this person I can honestly admire?"

Everyone has something worthy of appreciation. Find it.

---

### **Examples**

- Compliment a receptionist's efficiency
- Acknowledge a colleague's expertise
- Recognize a stranger's kindness
- Appreciate the small things people do

These moments matter more than you realize.

---

### **The opposite: making people feel small**

- Ignoring their contributions
- Taking credit for their work
- Dismissing their opinions
- Treating them as unimportant

This creates resentment and destroys relationships.
