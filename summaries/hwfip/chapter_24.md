### **Core idea:**

**Before criticizing others, talk about your own mistakes first.**

Put simply: **admitting your faults makes your feedback easier to accept.**

---

### **The central principle**

It's much easier to hear criticism from someone who admits they're imperfect too.

When you share your own mistakes, you create connection, not superiority.

> It isn't nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.

---

### **Why this works**

- It shows humility
- It equalizes the relationship
- It demonstrates understanding
- It makes criticism feel like advice, not judgment

"I've made this mistake too" is far more powerful than "You made a mistake."

---

### **How to apply this**

Before addressing someone's error:
- Recall a similar mistake you made
- Share it honestly
- Then address their issue with empathy

This isn't about being self-deprecating—it's about being human.

---

### **Example**

Instead of: "Your presentation lacked energy."

Try: "I remember when my presentations used to fall flat. I learned that varying my tone made a big difference. I think that might help you too."

---

### **The psychology**

People resist criticism from those who seem perfect.

They accept guidance from those who share their struggles.

---

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 3: Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Give criticism that's well-received
- Connect rather than alienate
- Lead with empathy

Then:
- Share your own faults first
- Show you understand the struggle
- Offer guidance, not judgment

**Humility opens ears that pride closes.**
