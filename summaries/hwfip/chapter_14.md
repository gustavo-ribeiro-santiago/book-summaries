### **Core idea:**

**Get the other person saying "yes" immediately.**

Put simply: **start with questions they'll agree with.**

---

### **The central principle**

When a person says "no," their entire body goes into rejection mode.

When they say "yes," they become open and receptive.

Start by getting agreement, not disagreement.

---

### **The Socratic method**

Socrates never told people they were wrong. Instead, he asked questions they had to agree with.

Step by step, these "yeses" led people to conclusions they would have rejected outright.

> Keep your opponent saying "yes" from the start.

---

### **Why this works psychologically**

- "Yes" creates forward momentum
- Agreement feels good—people want more
- It's harder to reverse course after multiple yeses
- It keeps the conversation positive

Each "yes" makes the next one easier.

---

### **How to apply this**

1. Identify points of agreement
2. Start with those—not your main point
3. Ask questions that lead to "yes"
4. Build toward your conclusion gradually

Never start with the controversial issue.

---

### **Example approach**

Instead of: "We need to cut the budget."

Try:
- "We all want the company to succeed, right?" (Yes)
- "And we agree we need to be efficient?" (Yes)
- "So let's look at where we might find savings..." (Conversation continues)

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 5: Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately.

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Persuade without conflict
- Build agreement gradually
- Avoid triggering resistance

Then:
- Start with common ground
- Ask questions that get "yes"
- Lead toward your point step by step

**A series of small agreements leads to big ones.**
