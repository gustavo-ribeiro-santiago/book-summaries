### **The central principle**

If you come at someone with fists raised, they'll raise theirs too.

But if you come with kindness and understanding, they're far more likely to listen.

> "A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall." — Abraham Lincoln

### **Why friendliness works**

- It lowers defenses
- It creates a cooperative atmosphere
- It shows respect
- It opens minds to your message

People are more persuaded by those they like.

---

### **The opposite approach fails**

Starting with:
- Anger
- Accusations
- Demands
- Threats

...creates resistance, not cooperation.

Even if you're right, you've made it harder to get what you want.

### **How to begin friendly**

- Start with genuine appreciation
- Find common ground
- Acknowledge their perspective
- Keep your tone warm and respectful

The beginning sets the tone for everything that follows.

---

### **Examples**

- A complaint handled warmly gets faster resolution
- A negotiation started friendly reaches agreement sooner
- A difficult conversation begun with kindness stays productive

Friendliness is not weakness—it's strategy.

### **The chapter's principle**

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Persuade effectively
- Resolve conflicts
- Get cooperation

Then:
- Start with warmth, not force
- Show respect before making requests
- Let friendliness open the door

**Gentleness and friendliness are always stronger than fury and force.**
