### **Core idea:**

**When nothing else works, throw down a challenge.**

Put simply: **stimulate competition and the desire to excel.**

### **The central principle**

People love a challenge. They love the chance to prove themselves.

When logic fails, appeal to their competitive spirit.

> The way to get things done is to stimulate competition—not in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.

### **Why challenges work**

- They tap into the desire to win
- They make work feel like a game
- They create intrinsic motivation
- They satisfy the need for achievement

People will do for pride what they won't do for money.

### **The human need to excel**

Everyone wants to feel capable and successful.

A challenge gives them a chance to prove it—to themselves and others.

---

### **How to apply this**

- Frame difficult tasks as challenges to overcome
- Create friendly competition
- Set ambitious but achievable goals
- Recognize and celebrate achievement

Turn "you have to" into "can you?"

---

### **Examples**

- A factory that tracks team performance sees productivity rise
- A sales team with visible rankings works harder
- A child challenged to beat their record practices more

Competition motivates where commands fail.
