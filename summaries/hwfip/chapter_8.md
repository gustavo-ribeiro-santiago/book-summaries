### **Core idea:**

**Talk about what interests the other person—not what interests you.**

Put simply: **speak in terms of the other person's interests.**

---

### **The central principle**

The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things they treasure most.

Before meeting someone, learn what they care about. Then bring it up.

---

### **Why this works**

- People light up when discussing their passions
- It shows you've done your homework
- It creates instant rapport
- It makes you memorable

When you talk about their interests, they associate those positive feelings with you.

---

### **How to apply this**

- Research people before meetings
- Ask about their hobbies, work, or achievements
- Notice what's in their office or home
- Pay attention to what excites them in conversation

Then guide the conversation toward those topics.

---

### **Examples from Carnegie**

- Theodore Roosevelt would stay up late reading about topics his guests cared about
- Successful salespeople research their clients' interests before calls
- Great leaders know what motivates each team member individually

Preparation shows respect.

---

### **The opposite approach fails**

- Talking about your interests bores people
- Showing off your knowledge creates distance
- Ignoring their passions makes you forgettable

People don't care what you know until they know you care about them.

---

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 5: Talk in terms of the other person's interests.

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Connect with anyone quickly
- Make lasting impressions
- Be welcomed into any conversation

Then:
- Find out what they care about
- Bring it up genuinely
- Let them share their passion

**The path to connection runs through the other person's heart, not your own.**
