### **Core idea:**

**When you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.**

Put simply: **own your mistakes before others point them out.**

---

### **The central principle**

If you know you're going to be criticized, say it yourself first—and say it thoroughly.

This disarms the critic and often turns their attack into sympathy.

---

### **Why this works**

- It takes courage to admit fault—people respect that
- It removes the critic's ammunition
- It often leads to forgiveness rather than punishment
- It shows integrity

The other person usually softens when you take responsibility.

---

### **The psychology**

When you defend yourself, people attack harder.

When you criticize yourself, people defend you.

> "By fighting, you never get enough, but by yielding, you get more than you expected."

---

### **How to apply this**

- Don't wait to be caught—confess first
- Don't minimize—be thorough about your error
- Don't make excuses—own it completely
- Don't repeat the mistake

A quick, full admission is far more powerful than a slow, defensive one.

---

### **The alternative: defending your mistakes**

- It looks weak, not strong
- It prolongs the conflict
- It damages trust
- It makes you look dishonest

Admitting error is a sign of strength, not weakness.

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 3: If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Turn critics into allies
- Earn respect even in failure
- Move past mistakes faster

Then:
- Admit your errors before others do
- Be thorough in your admission
- Don't defend—accept responsibility

**A person who admits their mistakes is more trusted than one who never makes any.**
