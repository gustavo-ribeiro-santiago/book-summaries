### **Core idea:**

**Make the fault seem easy to correct.**

Put simply: **encourage effort by making success feel achievable.**

---

### **The central principle**

If you tell someone a task is difficult, they become discouraged.

If you tell them it's manageable and they can do it, they try harder.

> Make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it.

---

### **Why this works**

- Confidence enables effort
- Discouragement prevents trying
- Belief in ability creates motivation
- Small steps feel achievable

People attempt what they believe they can accomplish.

---

### **How to apply this**

- Break big problems into small steps
- Emphasize their existing skills
- Share examples of others who succeeded
- Express confidence in their ability

"You can do this" is more powerful than "This is hard."

---

### **The opposite: discouragement**

Telling someone:
- "This is very difficult"
- "Most people fail at this"
- "I'm not sure you're ready"

...creates the failure you're trying to prevent.

---

### **Examples**

- "This is actually simpler than it looks. Let me show you."
- "You already have the skills for this. It's just applying them differently."
- "I've seen people master this quickly. You will too."

Make the mountain look like a hill.
