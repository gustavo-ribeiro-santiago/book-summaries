### **Core idea:**

**Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.**

Put simply: **empathy is the key to influence.**

### **The central principle**

Before you can persuade someone, you must understand them.

Why do they think what they think? What are their fears, needs, and motivations?

> "If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own." — Henry Ford

### **Why perspective-taking works**

- It reveals what truly motivates them
- It helps you craft better arguments
- It shows respect
- It builds trust and connection

You can't solve a problem you don't understand.

### **How to apply this**

Ask yourself:
- "Why would a reasonable person believe this?"
- "What do they want from this situation?"
- "What are they afraid of?"
- "What would I do in their position?"

Take time to genuinely understand before responding.

### **The shift in mindset**

Stop thinking: "How can I get what I want?"

Start thinking: "How can I help them get what they want while getting what I need?"

This transforms adversaries into partners.

### **The magic phrase**

Before any difficult conversation, say to yourself:

> "I don't blame them for feeling that way. If I were in their position, I would probably feel the same."

This creates empathy—and empathy creates connection.

**Understanding precedes influence.**
