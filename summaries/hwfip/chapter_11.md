### **Core idea:**

**Never tell someone they're wrong directly—it triggers defensiveness.**

Put simply: **show respect for other people's opinions.**

---

### **The central principle**

The moment you tell someone they're wrong, you've struck a blow to their pride, intelligence, and self-respect.

They will not want to change their mind—they will want to fight back.

---

### **Why directness fails**

- It implies superiority
- It wounds ego and pride
- It makes people defensive
- It closes their mind to your view

Even if you're right, you've lost the chance to persuade.

### **The psychology**

People don't hold opinions logically—they hold them emotionally.

When you attack an opinion, you're attacking the person who holds it.

### **How to disagree diplomatically**

Instead of: "You're wrong about that."

Try:
- "I may be wrong, but let me share another perspective..."
- "I see it differently—here's why..."
- "That's interesting. I'd always thought..."
- "Help me understand your reasoning..."

Leave room for both of you to be right.

### **The power of humility**

Admitting you might be wrong disarms the other person.

It opens the door to genuine dialogue instead of battle.

---

### **The chapter's principle**

> PRINCIPLE 2: Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong."

---

### **Bottom line**

If you want to:
- Change someone's mind
- Avoid making enemies
- Keep conversations productive

Then:
- Never tell people they're wrong directly
- Approach disagreements with humility
- Respect their right to their opinion

**Diplomacy wins where directness fails.**
